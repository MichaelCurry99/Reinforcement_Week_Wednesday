// 1. Create a javascript object that represents a food store product.
// The item should contain a name, description, bulk price, and consumer price. 
// console.log the result

// 2. Create a single method for printing the above object's name and description.


// 3. Create another method on the object from step 1 that returns a product's price with a discount applied.
// Supposing the product's price is 5, calling the discount method with a discount of 15% (0.15) will return 4.25.

// 4. Use a for-in loop to print out each property of the method (requires research from you :) )

// let weight = [];
// let price = [];
// let food = [];

let foodOne = {
   food: "fish",
   weight: 1.0,
   price: 5.00,

};

let foodTwo = {
    food: "steak",
    weight: 0.9,
    price: 4.00,

};

let foodThree = {
    food: "cheese",
    weight: 1.7,
    price: 7.00,

};

// console.log(foodOne,foodTwo,foodThree);

console.log(foodOne,foodTwo,foodThree);
